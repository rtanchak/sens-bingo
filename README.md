BINGO APP
- Build a fully working Bingo App using ReactJS.
- The game **must** always fit nicely to any screen-size (e.g. mobile).
- **Design your own version** – our game is an example. Be creative and pick your own design!
- Having a bingo requires some **nice visual reward**. You don't need to use confetti – choose something you believe fits best.
- Think of multiple gamers playing the Bingo together.. ensure that winning the game is possible and fair. (hint: if every player has the same card, everybody would win)
- Come up with something you would enjoy while playing the game.
